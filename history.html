<!-- 🔹 Restaurant History -->
<section class="container mb-5">
    <h2 class="mb-3 fs-3">History of Sin Yu</h2>
    <p class="fs-5">
        Sin Yu began in Plainfield, New Jersey, as a small family restaurant rooted in traditional Chinese cooking techniques.
        Founded by the Cheng family, the restaurant started out serving classic homemade dishes prepared with fresh ingredients,
        bold flavors, and recipes passed down across generations.
    </p>

    <p class="fs-5">
        From the beginning, Sin Yu focused on simple values: fresh ingredients, homestyle cooking, and treating every guest like part of the family. Recipes were inspired by generations of family traditions mixed with the unique style of Chinese-American cuisine that had grown popular across the country.
        Many of the restaurant’s earliest dishes — like fried rice, beef & broccoli, and egg rolls — were prepared exactly the way the Cheng family made them at home.
    </p>

    <p class="fs-5">
        As the years went on, Sin Yu embraced popular Chinese-American cuisine while still maintaining authenticity and respect for
        Chinese culinary culture. Our restaurant grew from a humble neighborhood spot into a well-loved dining destination, known
        for its generous portions, warm hospitality, and family-style cooking.
    </p>

    <p class="fs-5">
        Today, Sin Yu continues to honor its heritage by preparing every dish with care, treating customers like family, and sharing
        the flavors and traditions that shaped our story.

        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3 class="mb-3 fs-3">General Tso’s Chicken</h3>
            <p class="fs-4">
                General Tso’s Chicken, despite its name, did not originate in China.
                It was created in the 1970s by Taiwanese chefs in New York City who adapted Hunan-style flavors for American tastes.
                The dish combined crispy chicken with a sweet, tangy, slightly spicy sauce — a flavor profile that quickly spread across Chinese restaurants in the U.S.
                Though unknown in China until recently, it has become one of the most iconic dishes in Chinese-American cuisine.

    <!-- House special LoMein 2 -->
    <div class="row mb-4">
        <div class="col-md-6 order-md-2">
            <img src="Menu%20Item%20Pictures/House%20Special%20Lo%20Mein.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded shadow" alt="Lo Mein">
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6 order-md-1">
            <h3 class="mb-3 fs-3" >Lo Mein</h3>
            <p class="fs-4">
                Lo Mein originates from Cantonese cooking, where “lo” means “to toss.” Traditionally, the dish uses egg noodles tossed with vegetables and meats in a light savory sauce.
                When adapted for American restaurants, Lo Mein became saucier and heartier, turning into a comfort-food staple commonly served in takeout shops nationwide.

    <!-- Beef and Broccoli 3 -->

            <h3 class="mb-3 fs-3" >Beef with Broccoli</h3>
            <p class = "fs-4">
                While inspired by Cantonese stir-frying techniques, Beef with Broccoli is actually a Chinese-American invention.
                Chinese cooks substituted American broccoli for Chinese gai lan due to availability.
                Combined with tender marinated beef and a savory brown sauce, it quickly became a favorite because it offered familiar flavors with a healthy twist.

        <div class="col-md-6 order-md-1">
            <h3 class="mb-3 fs-3" > Chicken Egg Foo Young </h3>
            <p class="fs-4">
                Egg Foo Young is based on a traditional Chinese omelet made with vegetables and meats.
                In America, it became fluffier and is often served with a savory brown gravy.
                Chicken Egg Foo Young is a popular variation that blends classic Chinese cooking with the hearty, comforting flavors preferred in American diners.

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-6">
            <h3 class="mb-3 fs-3" >Sesame Chicken </h3>
            <p class="fs-4">
                Sesame Chicken was developed in the United States as a sweeter, more mild variation of General Tso’s Chicken.
                Featuring crispy chicken coated in a honey-soy glaze and topped with sesame seeds, the dish blends Chinese cooking techniques with American preferences for sweeter flavors.
                It has since become one of the most popular entrees in Chinese-American cuisine.

        <div class="col-md-6 order-md-1">
            <h3 class="mb-3 fs-3" >Sweet & Sour Pork</h3>
            <p class="fs-4">
                Sweet and Sour Pork has roots in Cantonese cuisine, where cooks experimented with balancing sugar and vinegar.
                However, the modern version — featuring crispy fried pork with pineapple, peppers, and bright red sauce — was developed in North America.
                Its vibrant flavor and colorful appearance made it especially popular with American diners.

            <h3 class="mb-3 fs-3">Hot & Sour Soup</h3>
            <p class="fs-4">
                Hot & Sour Soup is a traditional Sichuan dish known for its peppery heat and vinegar-based tang.
                Chinese-American restaurants altered the recipe to create a thicker, more mellow version with mushrooms, tofu, bamboo shoots, and egg ribbons.
                It remains one of the most popular soups due to its bold balanced flavors.

            <h3 class="mb-3 fs-3">Wonton Soup</h3>
            <p class="fs-4">
                Wonton Soup originates from Cantonese cuisine and features delicate pork-filled wontons in a clear broth.
                When adapted in the United States, the soup became milder and often included vegetables or additional seasonings.
                Its simple, comforting flavor keeps it popular as a starter or quick meal.

            <h3 class="mb-3 fs-3">Egg Drop Soup</h3>
            <p class="fs-4">
                Egg Drop Soup has ancient Chinese origins and was traditionally made with a simple broth and delicate “egg ribbons.”
                In American restaurants, cornstarch was added to create a thicker, silkier texture, and sometimes corn or peas are included. Despite its simplicity, it continues to be a comforting favorite across generations.

            <p class="fs-4">
                Egg rolls evolved from traditional Chinese spring rolls but were reinvented in the U.S. with a thicker wrapper and a hearty filling of cabbage, pork, carrots, and seasoning.
                Deep-fried to a crisp golden brown, egg rolls became a signature appetizer in Chinese-American restaurants throughout the 20th century.

            <p class="fs-4">
                Crab Rangoon is uniquely American. Created in the mid-20th century, likely at the famous Trader Vic’s restaurant, it blends cream cheese with crab meat and scallions inside a fried wonton shell.
                While not traditional Chinese cuisine, its rich, creamy flavor has made it one of the most beloved Chinese takeout appetizers.

            <h3 class="mb-3 fs-3">Fried Wontons</h3>
            <p class="fs-4">
                Wontons originated in northern China as a type of stuffed dumpling eaten during festivals.
                When Chinese immigrants brought the recipe to America, they began deep-frying them to create a crispy appetizer that paired well with sweet-and-sour dipping sauce.
                This crunchy version became widely popular in Chinese-American restaurants.

            <p class="fs-4">
                Chinese-style BBQ spare ribs trace back to Char Siu, a traditional Cantonese method of roasting pork with honey, soy sauce, and spices.
                Chinese-American restaurants adapted this into the glossy, reddish ribs commonly found on appetizer menus today.
                The dish blends smoky barbecue notes with distinctly Chinese seasonings.
